# logistic-regression
The task involves training a logistic regression model using scikit-learn's linear_model.LogisticRegression to classify different species of the Iris flower based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset, a widely used dataset in machine learning, contains measurements of these features for three species of the flower: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The objective is to build a model that accurately distinguishes between these species by fitting a logistic regression algorithm, which is ideal for classification problems. This task includes data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
